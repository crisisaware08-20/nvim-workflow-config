# NVim Workflow / Personal Development Environment

- [Unified Key Bindings](UNIFIED_KEY_BINDINGS.md)
- [Tmux + Nvim Navigation](TMUX_NVIM_NAVIGATION.md)

## Core Philosophy

The primary goal of this configuration is to reduce the friction between tmux and nvim, creating a seamless workflow where navigation and commands feel natural and integrated.

- **Tmux prefix**: `\` + command
- **Nvim leader**: `<space>` + command

This unified approach minimizes cognitive load and avoids conflicts with shell typing.
